What began as passive monitoring&mdash;of clicks, glances, purchases, paths&mdash;has evolved into something else entirely: a full-spectrum simulation of behavior, capable of inference, forecasting, and subtle coercion. We are no longer tracked. We are modeled&mdash;and therefore manipulated.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This white paper introduces and analyzes the emerging architecture I call Simulation-Based Agent Modeling (SBAM): a fusion of telemetry ingestion, behavioral patterning, identity inference, and synthetic prediction deployed across public, commercial, and state systems. While SBAM has no single inventor, vendor, or regime, its components are modular, increasingly interoperable, and already partially deployed around the globe. What unifies them is their core ambition: to construct dynamic behavioral twins of real individuals&mdash;not to understand them, but to anticipate and preempt them.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I refer to its apex form as BaconWAffen&mdash;a term that blends cultural irony with strategic dread. &ldquo;Bacon&rdquo; evokes the mesh of relational inference&mdash;the idea that everyone, everything, is only a few data points apart. &ldquo;Waffen&rdquo; draws from the historical obsession with Wunderwaffe, the totalizing superweapons of failed empires. BaconWAffen names a system whose violence is not kinetic, but epistemic: it dominates not with force, but with foresight.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SBAM is not the result of a single technological breakthrough. It is the convergence of multiple disciplines and infrastructures: behavioral economics, marketing automation, smart city telemetry, machine learning, social network analysis, predictive policing, and counterinsurgency modeling. These fields have fused into a new operational logic&mdash;a logic of simulation. Because each component was developed for legitimate or commercial use, the result is not one monolithic surveillance weapon but a distributed mesh of interoperable systems.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The defining feature of SBAM is its capacity to operate at forensic fidelity. These models do not just generalize population trends&mdash;they reconstruct individual behavior to a degree admissible in court. With the right data, one can reconstruct location, intent, and even cognitive state with chilling precision. The Times Square scenario presented in this paper is not fictional embellishment&mdash;it is a composite of existing technologies and documented capabilities.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is not science fiction. It does not speculate about a future system. It documents a present one&mdash;fragmented, underacknowledged, but rapidly converging. In smart cities, retail analytics platforms, counterterrorism units, social media ad engines, and hedge fund AI stacks, SBAM already pulses beneath the surface. The infrastructure is real. The ambition is real. The consequences, however, remain largely unexamined.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Across eight sections, I trace the technical foundations, operational lifecycle, forensic capabilities, real-world deployments, civic risks, and possible countermeasures of SBAM. The analysis is grounded in academic research, legal precedents, case studies, and documented government programs. This is a paper for both the technical reader and the policymaker, the systems designer and the civil libertarian.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">My goal is not merely to describe the system&mdash;but to make it visible, accountable, and contestable. Because the greatest danger of SBAM is not that it fails. It is that it works&mdash;and no one knows how to fight it.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">2. Methodology of Simulation-Based Agent Modeling (SBAM)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Agent modeling is not science fiction. It is a real, functioning system that simulates human behavior by using data you already emit every day. Simulation-Based Agent Modeling (SBAM) is how these systems work.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At its core, SBAM doesn&#39;t monitor just what you say or where you go&mdash;it learns how you move, when you act, what you respond to, and uses this to build a digital version of you that can be simulated. Unlike traditional surveillance, which records, SBAM predicts.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Definitions:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Agent: A simulated individual, created from patterns in data, whose actions and decisions can be forecasted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Telemetry: The stream of signals your devices emit&mdash;location pings, Bluetooth, app usage, and even how long you pause while scrolling.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Behavioral Synthesis: The process of combining these data signals into a coherent model that behaves like a human.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How It Works &mdash; Layer by Layer:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Spikes (Anchoring Points): These are small devices placed in the environment&mdash;on street signs, utility poles, or buildings&mdash;that create a verified point of detection. When a person or car moves nearby, their phone or Bluetooth device &ldquo;pings&rdquo; these spikes. That moment is recorded, time-stamped, and locked as proof.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Passive Telemetry: Your phone and car constantly emit data: to cell towers, to public WiFi, to advertisements that track foot traffic. All of these signals&mdash;legally bought, scraped, or passively received&mdash;tell the system how fast you&rsquo;re moving, where you stop, and how often you return.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Social Media Integration: Every selfie, check-in, and emotional post adds context. If the telemetry tells the system where you are, social media often tells it why.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How It Connects &mdash; Identity Without Names:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Agents emerge from data. You don&#39;t have to name someone directly; the system sees patterns. If a specific Bluetooth device keeps showing up near the same spike every morning and posts on Instagram from that location, it gets assigned an internal ID. This ID becomes persistent across systems.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But the notion that this process is truly anonymous is a legal fiction. In the data world&mdash;and especially in the eyes of the state&mdash;identity without explicit naming often carries the same weight as named identification. Unless a data stream is explicitly protected by law, such as under HIPAA (health data) or FERPA (student records), it can be bought, sold, and fused into a behavioral fingerprint that is functionally indistinct from knowing someone&rsquo;s legal name. For surveillance and prediction, what matters is not who you are on paper, but what your pattern of life reveals.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Through probabilistic modeling, the system gets more confident over time. It doesn&rsquo;t say, &ldquo;This is Jane Doe,&rdquo; but &ldquo;This is the same person who passed spike A at 7:43 AM and paused at the courthouse three days in a row.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s enough for targeting, for modeling, and in many cases, for state intervention.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">How It Predicts &mdash; From Behavior to Forecast:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once an agent has enough behavioral data, the model simulates forward. Where will this person go next? Are they likely to return to a location? Will they escalate in behavior? What do others who follow this pattern tend to do?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These simulations can include spatial movements, but also emotional patterns: &ldquo;This agent becomes more volatile after interactions with Agent B,&rdquo; or &ldquo;This cluster tends to form crowds within 18 hours of posting about grievance X.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Full Feedback Loop:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anchoring spikes record physical presence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Passive telemetry fills in motion and detail.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Narrative data explains motivation.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The system synthesizes a behavioral agent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It simulates that agent&rsquo;s future.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Real-world behavior is observed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">That new behavior retrains the model.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In this way, the system doesn&rsquo;t just track&mdash;it learns. The longer it runs, the more accurate it becomes. Each person becomes a node in a vast, self-updating map of probable actions.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">For the public, this might seem abstract. But if you&rsquo;ve ever had a friend say, &ldquo;My phone knew what I was thinking,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the consumer-grade version. BaconWAffen describes what happens when that same modeling is tied not just to ads&mdash;but to movement, emotion, dissent, and law.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This system is no longer theoretical. What remains is to decide who controls it, who understands it, and whether the people being modeled ever get a say.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">3. From Detection to Dominion: Lifecycle of a Modeled Agent</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A modeled agent begins with a signal&mdash;a phone ping, a license plate read, a Bluetooth handshake, or a social media post with embedded metadata. These are not covert acts of espionage. They are mundane, passive, and almost always legal. But to a system designed to remember, infer, and simulate, they serve as the first cell in an organism of surveillance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Stage 1: Initial Detection &mdash; Entry Point as Ontological Claim</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The lifecycle of a modeled agent begins with what we call a &quot;telemetric spark&quot;: any signal that can be temporally and spatially logged. Common entry points include:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Mobile telemetry: cell tower registration, IMSI capture, eSIM behavior (see 3GPP TS 23.003; https://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.003/)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Wireless emissions: WiFi probe requests, Bluetooth advertisements, NFC transactions (Narayanan &amp; Shmatikov 2010; https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~shmat/shmat_oak10.pdf)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">License plate capture: fixed ALPR infrastructure (e.g. Flock, Vigilant), mobile LPR on police or repo vehicles (EFF, &ldquo;Automated License Plate Readers&rdquo;; https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Platform activity: geotagged posts, check-ins, or metadata-laced media from platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Purchase or movement logs: toll booths, transit cards (e.g. Oyster, MetroCard), tap-to-pay events</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Each signal type is time-bound and location-bound. A phone that connects to a tower at 8:43am near 12th and Market, paired with a Bluetooth ping from a known car system at the same spot, is enough to create a temporal signature. The system now has a candidate presence&mdash;an agent stub.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Stage 2: Identity Fusion &mdash; Binding Signals into Persistent Threads</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The next step is correlating disparate signals across datasets to build a cohesive model. This is achieved through a technique called probabilistic identity fusion. Rather than depending on names, it relies on overlap in behavior and signal consistency. Methods include:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Signal triangulation: cross-referencing tower handoffs, MAC addresses, and mobile app telemetry (de Montjoye et al. 2013; https://www.nature.com/articles/srep01376)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Hash collision tracking: following anonymized identifiers as they are transformed across platforms (e.g., via IDFA or GAID on apps)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Purchase shadowing: time-synced transactions via credit/debit, often acquired from brokers, which anchor agents in commercial space (FTC, Data Brokers Report 2014; https://www.ftc.gov/reports/data-brokers-call-transparency-accountability-report-federal-trade-commission-may-2014)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Behavioral fingerprinting: analysis of unique traits like device motion, typing cadence, scroll velocity, or phone orientation (Mayer &amp; Mutchler 2016; https://webpolicy.org/2016/03/03/metaphone-fingerprinting-phones-by-accelerometer-data/)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Environmental resonance: linking device data to environmental sensors like sound levels, air quality, or public video feeds (proof-of-concept studies in multimodal sensor fusion; e.g., MIT CSAIL work on cross-modal learning)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Legal identities are not needed here. What matters is recurrence. If a set of signals behaves the same way, in the same places, over time, the system regards it as a singular actor. It assigns a persistent agent ID.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Stage 3: Behavioral Threading &mdash; Building the Multi-Dimensional Profile</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Once an agent is stable, its history is assembled across three axes:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Spatial: mapping the geographic range of movement, identifying habitual nodes (home, work, third places), and flagging anomalies or novelties</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Temporal: constructing a schedule pattern, including weekday vs. weekend behavior, shift changes, and deviation markers</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Emotional/Narrative: parsing linguistic tone in social media, tracking content themes, cross-referencing public video expressions (facial affect recognition), and even aggregating sentiment from device vibration patterns or biometric feedback (e.g., heart rate, stress metrics from wearables) (Pennebaker et al., Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count; https://www.liwc.app/; Kramer et al. 2014, Facebook emotional contagion study; https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Stage 4: Forecasting &mdash; Predictive Modeling of Agent Behavior</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Using machine learning models&mdash;often trained on regional cohorts or individualized baselines&mdash;the system extrapolates:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Next likely location: based on prior spatial rhythms and contextual cues (weather, transit closures, nearby events)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Encounter probabilities: identifying high-likelihood agent intersections, useful for tracing, contact modeling, or disruption scenarios</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Behavioral escalation: scoring emotional volatility, political radicalization vectors, or operational readiness (in adversarial models)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Intent mapping: linking inferred desires (based on movement + narrative data) to system vulnerabilities or risk flags</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Techniques used include:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Markov Chains (Rabiner 1989; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/18626)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">LSTM and Transformer models (Hochreiter &amp; Schmidhuber 1997; Vaswani et al. 2017)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Bayesian belief networks (Pearl 1988)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">GANs (Goodfellow et al. 2014; https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2014/hash/5ca3e9b122f61f8f06494c97b1afccf3-Abstract.html)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Stage 5: Synthetic Engagement &mdash; Influencing the Agent&rsquo;s Future</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At scale, these models cease to be passive. Through synthetic engagement, the system uses its forecast to shape behavior. Examples include:</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Content injection: tailored narratives pushed to social feeds, designed to confirm, agitate, or placate (Sunstein &amp; Thaler 2008; &ldquo;Nudge&rdquo;)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Service modulation: altering app behavior (delays, friction, or targeting) based on behavioral score</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Environmental cues: adjusting lighting, signage, or public audio via smart city controls to trigger affective shifts (IBM Smart Cities, https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_cities/overview/)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Feedback manipulation: showing confirmation signals (e.g., &ldquo;X people agree with you&rdquo;) to induce confidence or conformity</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The agent, in this final stage, is no longer being modeled. It is being nudged. Its simulated path becomes a design surface for governance&mdash;soft, deniable, and real.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Applied Example: Collision in Times Square</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Let us return to Times Square&mdash;not as a spectacle, but as a sensor-rich forensic grid. At 3:16:24 PM, a cab strikes a bike messenger near 44th and Broadway. No direct eyewitnesses are willing to speak. No traditional CCTV provides a clear view. Yet the event exists in the machine.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A MAID node installed on a lamppost logs a Bluetooth handshake from the cab&#39;s infotainment system and a spike from the cyclist&rsquo;s phone seeking a WiFi network. A public-facing LoRa pinger records environmental telemetry including vehicle noise, vibration levels from pavement sensors, and ambient sound captured by smart signage (CityBridge nodes).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">From nearby retail storefronts, private security camera networks (ringed by passive RF sniffers) capture MAC address pings from passing mobile devices. That dataset cross-references mobile ad ID logs available from commercial data brokers (e.g., Venntel, Cuebiq), which confirm the cab&rsquo;s route over the previous 12 minutes.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">ALPR infrastructure affixed to delivery vans and rideshare vehicles&mdash;some commercial, some operated by NYPD&mdash;capture the license plate of the cab at multiple time points. The vehicle&rsquo;s on-board diagnostics, accessible via subpoena or broker agreement, show unusual throttle behavior: deceleration begins at 3:16:23, but brake pressure falls mid-application at 3:16:25. RPMs spike. The model flags this as a likely false stop&mdash;braking engaged but aborted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But the real forensic closure comes from deep identity resolution. The driver&rsquo;s mobile device, confirmed through persistent Bluetooth signature, IMSI logs, and MAC fingerprinting, is matched with a personal account linked to a verified Gmail registration, purchase receipts from an e-wallet, and a login to a ride-hailing app three minutes prior to the crash. These signals crossmatch with his Instagram, where a post from earlier that day references workplace stress, alcohol use, and derogatory remarks toward delivery cyclists of a specific ethnicity. The post is time-stamped and geotagged near a liquor store captured earlier by the cab&rsquo;s ALPR footprint.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The cyclist&rsquo;s identity is also reconstructed. His mobile device&mdash;seen in previous days across known courier hubs&mdash;is linked to a work-issued device registered with a regional delivery app. Health metadata from a smartwatch confirms biometric stress markers: sudden deceleration, impact force, and cardiac spike. His recent social media shows on-duty check-ins with courier partners, creating timestamped visual corroboration.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The surrounding social fabric is likewise observable. Crowd behavior shifts at the moment of impact: phones unlock, call logs spike, app data shows real-time video uploads to TikTok and Instagram Stories. Several public posts contain indirect footage&mdash;reflections in windows, pan scans past the scene. Within ninety seconds, the system surfaces five unique social media records within a 25-meter radius of the collision.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Together, this layered telemetry builds a forensic reconstruction: the vehicle&rsquo;s presence, trajectory, and mechanical behavior; the driver&rsquo;s digital psychology, bias history, and real-time location; the cyclist&rsquo;s physical trauma profile and occupational verification; and the affective temperature of the crowd. Without a single camera pointed directly at the incident, the machine sees&mdash;because it remembers everything else.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is not speculative. Every element of this reconstruction uses only commercially available, subpoena-accessible, or publicly leaked systems. The power of Simulation-Based Agent Modeling lies not in a singular tool, but in the composite correlation of thousands of legal, independent systems. It produces not just evidence, but narrative. Not just presence, but motive. And in court&mdash;as in policy&mdash;what matters most is what can be shown, timed, and believed.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">4. Real-World Analogues and Actors</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What has been described so far is not theoretical. Every element of Simulation-Based Agent Modeling (SBAM) has real-world analogues already active, fragmented across domains, institutions, and borders. While no single entity yet possesses the full BACONWAFFEN stack in its integrated form, many have assembled powerful subsets&mdash;and in doing so, shaped the landscape of predictive governance, corporate surveillance, and civic threat modeling.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Nation-State Deployments</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The United States&rsquo; NSA and its Five Eyes partners (UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) have long practiced global telemetry capture under legal frameworks like PRISM and XKeyscore, enabling large-scale metadata correlation (Greenwald 2014). China&#39;s Ministry of State Security and contractors like Hikvision combine ALPR, facial recognition, social scoring, and app surveillance into a comprehensive SBAM-like infrastructure targeting both domestic dissent and ethnic minorities (Creemers et al., 2018; Human Rights Watch, 2019).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Russia&rsquo;s FSB operates an ecosystem of metadata mining from telecom providers and OSINT harvesting that is increasingly fused with location analytics, especially post-Ukraine invasion, for counterintelligence and narrative warfare. The Israeli firm NSO Group&rsquo;s Pegasus system offers targeted, full-stack behavioral penetration to client states, proving that nation-state-grade tooling is already a commercial export product.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Corporate Intelligence and Data Brokerage</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Entities like Palantir, Recorded Future, and Babel Street have operationalized parts of SBAM for clients in defense, finance, and law enforcement. These tools build agent-like profiles from scraped data, mobile signals, and OSINT, delivering predictive dashboards with embedded judgment scores. Data brokers such as Acxiom, Oracle Data Cloud, and Experian aggregate consumer behavior across billions of profiles, many of which are resold to state actors or contractors under counterterrorism or fraud-prevention justifications.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Commercial applications also include marketing platforms like LiveRamp or Neustar, which do not need names to operate. Instead, they rely on persistent digital exhaust&mdash;device IDs, home IP addresses, location traces&mdash;which they correlate across verticals to segment and simulate purchasing behavior, susceptibility to influence, or churn risk.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Private Sector Urban and Retail Modeling</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">At the city scale, companies like ShotSpotter, Flock Safety, and Rekor Systems deploy sensor grids that model both real-time behavior and long-term agent trajectories. Retail environments use heatmapping, facial analytics, RFID tracing, and app-integrated loyalty behavior to recreate digital twins of consumer motion and preference. These systems, while framed in terms of safety or customer experience, function as bounded SBAM instances within enclosed systems.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Real-time location firms like Placer.ai and SafeGraph track foot traffic at granular resolution using mobile SDKs, with use cases spanning urban planning, competitive intelligence, and pandemic response. These platforms increasingly resemble proto-geographic cognition engines, capable of reconstructing crowd behavior and predicting commercial migration.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">NGO and Civic Sector Use (and Risk)</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Some NGOs have turned to simulation modeling for harm reduction or accountability. Organizations like Amnesty International and Bellingcat use satellite imagery, public telemetry, and leaked datasets to reconstruct war crimes and state abuses&mdash;sometimes reverse-engineering SBAM-style models to uncover truths hidden by state opacity.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But these same tools are unevenly available. Wealthy NGOs and Western civil society actors may deploy lightweight versions of these systems, while at-risk communities&mdash;refugees, journalists, protesters&mdash;become the modeled. Without equal access or a civic safeguard layer, SBAM techniques risk reinforcing structural asymmetries.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What emerges, then, is a battlefield not of arms, but of cognition. The side with better simulation wins not because it shoots first, but because it frames the question&mdash;and predicts the answer&mdash;before others know the game is in motion.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Coming Democratization of SBAM</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Historically, this level of modeling required classified infrastructure, privileged access to telecom metadata, and high-cost compute clusters. That is no longer true. As edge computing, GPU miniaturization, and open-source telemetry stacks proliferate, much of SBAM&rsquo;s scaffolding is becoming available to hobbyists, rogue actors, or citizen investigators with only modest resources.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Off-the-shelf microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi and ESP32 boards can run passive WiFi/Bluetooth sniffers for less than $100. Open-source platforms like OpenCV and TensorFlow Lite make real-time facial recognition deployable on devices the size of a phone charger. Mobile SDKs harvested from Android apps provide access to GPS, accelerometer, and ad ID data that can be ingested into custom dashboards using open-source GIS tools (e.g., QGIS, GeoServer).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GCP offer low-latency compute and storage at pennies per hour. Combined with pre-trained large language models and open-data brokerage APIs, even small collectives can now simulate behavioral profiles, model crowd flows, or perform identity fusion without state backing.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This decentralization opens the door to civic resistance and bottom-up accountability. But it also removes the traditional friction that kept powerful analytics exclusive to state or enterprise. The future of SBAM is not just about who builds it&mdash;but who builds it first, fastest, and in whose interest. The next wave of deployments may come not from Langley, Shenzhen, or Tel Aviv, but from a toolchain stitched together in a shipping container lab behind a gas station in Kentucky&mdash;or a co-op basement in Berlin.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But the same accessibility that enables civic power also enables harm. As the components of SBAM become more modular and cheaper to deploy, bad actors no longer need state backing or corporate R&amp;D. Sophisticated scams&mdash;once the domain of black hat firms&mdash;will become scriptable. Phishing campaigns augmented by behavioral forecasting will anticipate victim responses in real time. Targeted disinformation can be automated to exploit each user&rsquo;s emotional cadence.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Doxxing, long feared as a fringe harassment tactic, will become a one-click operation. By stitching together mobile ad IDs, scraped social profiles, leaked consumer databases, and location history, an attacker with limited technical skill could surface someone&#39;s workplace, habits, romantic relationships, political affiliations, and biometric indicators&mdash;all within minutes. Identity destruction at scale becomes an affordance, not a threat.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The decentralization of SBAM carries an unacknowledged dual use: the same simulation tools that promise bottom-up accountability can also be weaponized for stalking, reputational sabotage, coercive control, and digital vigilantism. Proto-events already suggest the scope of this risk. In 2020, hobbyists using open WiFi sniffers and scraped social profiles coordinated real-world harassment campaigns against protestors by linking MAC addresses to public data (see Citizen Lab reports; https://citizenlab.ca). More recently, Telegram groups have distributed scripts for real-time doxxing using exposed adtech identifiers and location-brokered data, leading to a wave of targeted threats during regional elections (EFF, 2022; https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/04/phone-location-data-doxxing-and-digital-vigilantism). AI-enhanced phishing toolkits now offer behavioral targeting as a service, packaging psychological insight from social media posts into adaptive scripts (Wired, 2023; https://www.wired.com/story/phishing-as-a-service-ai-scam-platforms/).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Unless constraints are built into the design layer&mdash;or enforced culturally through transparency and deterrence&mdash;the democratization of simulation will not just rebalance power. It may collapse trust altogether.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">5. Risks, Abuses, and Iatrogenic Tyranny</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Tyranny of Forecasting</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SBAM creates not just models&mdash;but narratives. When simulations are treated as truth, risk becomes pre-crime, and possibility becomes guilt. In this mode, systems act preemptively: freezing accounts, denying insurance, initiating welfare checks, or escalating police presence&mdash;based not on what someone has done, but on what their modeled self is likely to do. This predictive posture is already visible in threat scoring algorithms used by fusion centers (e.g., &ldquo;Suspicious Activity Reports&rdquo; or SARs) and in China&rsquo;s &ldquo;pre-criminal&rdquo; A.I. surveillance systems (Creemers, 2018).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Structural Bias and Algorithmic Reproduction</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">These systems don&rsquo;t eliminate bias&mdash;they automate it. Predictive policing models often rely on historical crime data that overrepresents minority communities due to decades of over-policing (Richardson et al., 2019). Sentencing models like COMPAS have demonstrated racial disparities (Angwin et al., ProPublica, 2016). Once this bias is baked into training data, it becomes invisible behind a layer of statistical precision. The outputs may look neutral. The inputs are not.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Narrative Capture and Weaponized Information</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Because agent models simulate behavior, they become vulnerable to weaponized framing. A fake social media post seeded into an agent&rsquo;s predicted trail can be treated as a behavioral anchor by the system. This opens doors for false flags, &ldquo;noise flooding,&rdquo; and counterinsurgency tactics dressed as algorithmic hygiene. Military doctrine has already begun folding cognitive warfare into cyber and kinetic planning (NATO, 2020).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Soft Totalitarianism through Infrastructure</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Control no longer requires laws. It requires systems that learn your limits and shape them subtly. From recommendation algorithms to urban flow modeling, SBAM can implement &ldquo;nudge governance&rdquo; (Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008) at scale. A person never sees the alternative they were denied. Dissent doesn&rsquo;t have to be crushed&mdash;it can be predicted, redirected, and pre-empted.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Iatrogenic Harm at the Systemic Level</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Attempts to reduce risk often introduce new categories of harm. Predictive tools used in education flag students as potential threats, placing them on law enforcement radars based on minor behavioral cues (often without parental knowledge). In healthcare, emotion analysis tools flag patients for wellness checks that may result in state intervention. Systems designed to protect begin to surveil, diagnose, and manage autonomy without consent.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Irreversibility and Data Haunting</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The permanence of modeling is a critical danger. SBAM agents are long-lived structures. A false pattern&mdash;once accepted&mdash;can shadow a person indefinitely, especially as models inform future iterations. There is no formal appeal process for most simulation-based systems. They are not built to be reversed. They are built to learn.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Weaponization and Targeted Psychological Operations</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">When SBAM systems are hijacked or custom-deployed, they serve as high-resolution engines of psychological warfare. Harassment becomes targeted not just to where a person is&mdash;but to when they are weakest. Disinformation arrives at emotional inflection points. Threats are timed to moments of predicted isolation. These tactics have already been deployed against journalists, dissidents, and whistleblowers (see Amnesty Tech 2022; Citizen Lab 2021).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In aggregate, the greatest risk of SBAM is not totalitarian control&mdash;it is the erosion of knowable reality. When every signal can be simulated, and every behavior pre-evaluated, the distinction between truth and forecast collapses. That is not simply surveillance. It is the birth of epistemic tyranny&mdash;where belief is governed by probability, not proof.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">6. Ethical and Civic Implications</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Consent in the Age of Ambient Exposure</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In a world mediated by SBAM, consent becomes obsolete. The individual is no longer an active participant in their data trail. Signals&mdash;location pings, app behaviors, biometric shifts&mdash;are emitted ambiently, continuously. Most are harvested without direct knowledge. What does consent mean when it is never asked, only inferred or bypassed entirely through third-party collection? Opt-out becomes a myth. The modern subject is not asked to share&mdash;they simply leak.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The Absence of Oversight</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">No regulatory framework has kept pace with SBAM&rsquo;s convergence of commercial, civic, and state surveillance capabilities. Existing bodies&mdash;like the FTC or European Data Protection Boards&mdash;were designed to handle breaches and violations, not real-time synthetic behavioral models. Enforcement is jurisdictionally fragmented, technologically outpaced, and structurally reactive. In this vacuum, systems proliferate by default.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Public Resilience and Countermeasures</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Resilience also requires education. Digital literacy training must now include counter-surveillance techniques: understanding data exhaust, recognizing tracking systems, and learning how to disrupt or confuse behavioral modeling. Just as basic civics teaches rights and responsibilities, digital civics must teach privacy hygiene, adversarial use of public space, and recognition of coercive interfaces. In schools, libraries, and community centers, defensive simulation awareness should become a core competency&mdash;on par with cybersecurity.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If full protection is not possible, then civic resilience becomes a survival strategy. Public countermeasures include data obfuscation tools (e.g., location spoofing, ad ID resets), community education on data minimization, and adversarial design practices that inject noise into telemetry streams. These are not solutions&mdash;they are mitigation attempts, often fragile and temporary. But they create space for awareness, subversion, and resistance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Transparency as Defense, Obfuscation as Tactic</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Defensive transparency means exposing the existence and logic of SBAM systems&mdash;forcing them into public discourse and regulatory scrutiny. At the same time, strategic obfuscation (e.g., data poisoning, coordinated behavior spoofing) becomes a form of civic hygiene. In the absence of protective law, subversion becomes the ethical stance. A society that does not know how it is modeled cannot meaningfully consent, resist, or reform.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The ethics of SBAM are not reducible to compliance checklists. They are existential: what does it mean to be free when your forecast precedes your name? What does it mean to be safe when your shadow can be weaponized? And what civic structure can survive when trust itself becomes a probabilistic artifact?</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">7. Strategic Responses and Design Recommendations</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The systems that power SBAM cannot be uninvented. The ethical question now is not whether they will be used, but how&mdash;and by whom. Strategic response begins not with prohibition, but with parity. Civic actors, academic institutions, and watchdog NGOs must develop parallel simulation capabilities. These should not mimic state or corporate surveillance for control but instead repurpose modeling for transparency, accountability, and structural resilience.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Transparency as Resistance</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">A civic counter-modeling architecture would simulate power itself: mapping who watches whom, where data flows, and how decisions are shaped algorithmically. Just as simulations can predict protest, they can also predict overreach. Public dashboards, investigative modeling, and synthetic journalism can expose otherwise invisible systems. In this framing, transparency is not a regulatory gesture&mdash;it is a resistance strategy. Precedents include the Pentagon Papers (1971), the Snowden disclosures (2013), and ongoing work by Bellingcat, which uses open-source simulation and geolocation tools to hold state actors accountable (Higgins, We Are Bellingcat: An Intelligence Agency for the People, 2021).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Civic Epistemology: Training for the Simulated Era</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The most important countermeasure may be epistemic: training the public to distinguish between truth, probability, and simulation. This means embedding simulation literacy into school curricula, public service announcements, and media production. People must be taught how narratives are modeled, how behavioral twins are created, and how to spot the influence of a forecast before mistaking it for a fact. Danah Boyd&rsquo;s work at Data &amp; Society warns that traditional media literacy fails when trust in institutions collapses&mdash;simulation literacy must go further, exposing how truths are constructed and modeled probabilistically (https://points.datasociety.net/you-think-you-want-media-literacy-do-you-7cad6af18ec2).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Designing for Trust: Fail-Open Architectures</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">SBAM tools&mdash;when unavoidable&mdash;must be designed to fail safely and visibly. This requires &ldquo;fail-open&rdquo; architectures, where the collapse of a model defaults to disclosure, not silent degradation. Users must be able to query their own simulation, audit its logic, and contest its predictions. This is not just user rights. It is social self-defense. Transparency must be embedded at the model layer, not merely appended as afterthought. The danger of silent failure was made clear in 2018, when Amazon&rsquo;s facial recognition tool misidentified 28 U.S. Congress members as criminal suspects using a mugshot dataset (https://www.aclu.org/news/privacy-technology/amazon-rekognition-falsely-matched-28-members-of-congress).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Agency Over the Digital Self</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We must insist that the digital self is not a corporate artifact or a state resource&mdash;it is an extension of personhood. The same moral and legal agency we assert over our physical body must apply to the behavioral twin, the data shadow, the probabilistic double. Without this principle, there can be no ethical simulation. Agency means the right to know when we are being modeled, to shape the terms of that modeling, and to withhold ourselves entirely. Existing legal frameworks like the GDPR (EU) and CCPA (California) recognize these rights in rudimentary form&mdash;affirming data access, deletion, and consent protocols&mdash;but fall short of addressing real-time simulation (https://gdpr-info.eu; https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Toward a Treaty on Cognitive Autonomy</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The final recommendation is diplomatic: SBAM needs an international regulatory regime. Just as chemical weapons and nuclear arsenals have treaties, cognitive weapons must be governed by binding norms. This includes prohibitions on autonomous simulation without consent, on simulation-based targeting for law enforcement or war, and on commercial sale of closed-loop behavior modification systems. The PRC&rsquo;s use of emotion recognition and predictive surveillance to profile Uyghurs (https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/11/24/china-algorithms-threaten-privacy; https://ipvm.com/reports/megvii-uyghur) exemplifies the stakes. NATO&rsquo;s 2020 inclusion of the &ldquo;cognitive domain&rdquo; as a recognized field of warfare confirms that these systems are no longer theoretical&mdash;they are operational (https://www.act.nato.int/articles/the-cognitive-warfare-concept). A &ldquo;Cognitive Geneva Convention&rdquo; may sound aspirational&mdash;but without it, information warfare becomes the permanent state of society.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">8. Conclusion: A Moment Before the Mirage Sets</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Simulation-Based Agent Modeling is no longer hypothetical. It is being deployed in real time, across commercial, military, and civic domains. What we have described here&mdash;the construction, manipulation, and projection of behavioral models&mdash;is not a distant technology. It is already in use.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">And yet, this is only the beginning. The use of AI agents for population-scale inference, forecasting, and influence is a recent development&mdash;barely a decade old in serious implementation. But the scope of what they are already capable of would have staggered even the most prophetic science fiction writers. These systems can anticipate not just motion, but emotion. They can trace not just action, but intention.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">More disturbingly, they operate in a conceptual field where identity is already becoming an unstable fiction. In the realm of data, there is no self&mdash;only clusters of probability, persistent behavioral shadows, and feedback loops. Legal identity exists only where it has been declared, stored, or enforced. In this context, calls for &ldquo;universal ID&rdquo; or &ldquo;digital sovereignty&rdquo; may sound reassuring, but they risk cementing the very systems they are meant to question.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Already, pieces of the SBAM stack are actively deployed across sectors. Targeted advertising engines use probabilistic modeling of user behavior, smart city infrastructure links passive sensors with identity resolution layers, and law enforcement partners with third-party data brokers for behavioral predictions. While few actors can yet field full simulations, all the components exist&mdash;and are accessible to those with modest funding and technical literacy. As we&rsquo;ve argued, it only takes a dollar and a dream.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This paper does not call for panic. It calls for preparation. Simulation must be met with simulation. Modeling must be matched with public oversight. And most importantly, the behavioral twin must be treated not as a consumer profile or a national security threat&mdash;but as an emergent part of personhood. In that understanding lies the possibility of dignity, restraint, and informed resistance.</span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c1"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
