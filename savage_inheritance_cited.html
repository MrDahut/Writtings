  <h1>Savage Inheritance</h1>

  <p>I am a savage man because I am American. It is my inheritance, in all its glory and filth. No matter how many great books I read, no matter how many noble ideals I repeat, the fact remains: this nation was built by conquest, and conquest sits in me. The same fire that drives me to learn, to build, to rise higher is the same fire that drove my ancestors to enslave and erase. We are not innocent. We carry both in our blood—the scars of the besieged and the arrogance of the besieger.</p>

  <p>We tell each other we are kings, but we refuse to kneel. We tell our victims it is all right, because we are right, but we deny the value and correctness of others. Every cruelty is recast as virtue, every theft retold as destiny. To be American is to live inside that double-vision, where the weapon and the wound are one and the same.</p>

  <p>This is how virtue signals sit like war-dresses on a Karen’s bangs. Hashtag marks score the social body like a thousand razor cuts, each one proof of righteousness, proof of belonging. But none of it is about what we owe each other. It’s about what people think they deserve, what they want, what they can take. The savage inheritance just adapts. Rifles turn into retweets, frontiers into feeds. The hunger doesn’t change.</p>

    “Celebrate white independence, it’s great.”<br/>
    “America is a pyramid scheme.”<br/>

  </blockquote>

  <p>People pretend the story starts with Columbus, but they never ask what was here the day before. The Americas were not wilderness—they were one-fifth of humanity. One hundred and fifty million people lived here, with cities bigger than London, roads longer than Rome, and ecological systems so advanced we are only now starting to understand them. Tenochtitlán with its causeways and floating gardens. Cuzco and its terraced mountains feeding millions. Cahokia, the mound city on the Mississippi, trading copper and shells from one end of the continent to the other. Amazonia with its black earth soils, engineered by human hands to last for millennia. Forests burned to open prairies, fisheries managed, bison herds stabilized, oak groves curated. What looked like wilderness was actually design—biological logic guiding entire ecosystems.</p>

  <p>Then came the silent conquest. Disease swept faster than armies. Smallpox, measles, influenza—whole nations erased before Europeans even saw them. Nine out of ten gone in some places. And what should have been tragedy was turned into strategy. Settlers called it providence, God’s will clearing the land for their use. Survivors starved as fields went fallow and ecosystems collapsed under livestock and logging. Dependency became the weapon: to eat, you had to submit. Treaties finished the job—written in foreign tongues, signed under duress, ignored when inconvenient. Conquest didn’t need cannons when it had plague, famine, and paper.</p>

  <p>And even when Native nations did everything the occupier demanded, it wasn’t enough. The so-called Five Civilized Tribes farmed with plows, wrote constitutions, sent their children to schools, built towns with presses and churches. Still, they were driven out. Cherokee farmers in Georgia were forced from their homes, their fields handed by lottery to white settlers. The Trail of Tears marched them west through mud and snow, thousands dying along the way. The lesson was plain: assimilation was never the point. It wasn’t about civilization, it was about land. There was no room for neighbors, only room for replacements.</p>

  <p>The Dawes Act carried the same logic into law. Divide the land into allotments, open the rest to settlers. The Dawes Rolls—lists of who was and who wasn’t an Indian—froze identity in government ink, excluding as many as possible. Families split on paper. Freedmen stripped from tribes. Generations later, those same rolls are still used to decide who belongs. Conquest didn’t just take the land; it rewrote bloodlines.</p>

  <p>And it wasn’t just Natives. Africans were chained and bred into chattel. Mexicans were conquered on their own soil and reduced to peons. Chinese laborers built the rails and were then banned by law from belonging. Italians, Irish, Jews, Slavs—all white in skin, but not yet white in standing—beaten in the streets, lynched, barred from unions, shoved into mines and sweatshops. Eventually they were absorbed into whiteness, but only by stepping on the necks of those kept permanently outside. Belonging in America has never been a birthright—it has always been a conquest.</p>

  <p>That’s the pattern. Whoever arrives is an enemy until they are conquered or useful. And even then, the line shifts. Whiteness itself isn’t a color—it’s a contract. You are in only so long as you help keep someone else out. That’s why the savage inheritance touches everyone. Even “white” Americans carry stories of exclusion—grandfathers spit on for their accent, great-grandmothers locked in tenements, coal miners beaten down by Pinkertons. They too were once besieged before they were invited to join the besieger’s side.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the world moves on. Europe fought its endless wars, then drew borders and built parliaments. Africa endured colonization, then shook off empires and built nations. Asia folded conquest into dynasties and bureaucracies. But America never stopped reverting. The frontier closed, so we opened another—Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan. Every generation invents a new enemy, a new savage to pacify. Every reform—emancipation, Reconstruction, Civil Rights—meets its backlash, its regression, its reminder that the wound is also the weapon.</p>

  <blockquote>
    “The wound that was made when white people came and took all that they took has never healed. An unattended wound gets infected.”<br/>
    <span class="small">— Tommy Orange, <em>There There</em></span>
  </blockquote>

  <p>That is our inheritance: savage not because we are primitive, but because we are trapped in the logic of conquest. We are at once the besieger and the besieged. The occupier, always afraid of being replaced. The victim, always afraid of being erased. We mythologize our violence as virtue—cowboys, pioneers, soldiers, entrepreneurs, influencers—dressing up domination as freedom.</p>

  <p>And here’s the part that keeps me angry: this doesn’t have to last forever. Epigenetic scars fade if you stop cutting them open. Cultures of violence degrade if you stop rewarding them. The savage inheritance is not a curse of blood—it is a system, a logic, and systems can be broken.</p>

  <p>But breaking it means letting go of the wealth and power conquest gave us. That’s the sticking point. We want to heal without losing the plunder. We want to call ourselves free while still hoarding the chains. And it doesn’t work like that. You can’t have peace while still playing conqueror.</p>

  <p>So I’m calling out my fellow Americans: can we, for once, fucking do better? Not in slogans, not in hashtags, not in virtue-dresses worn like war paint, but in actually breaking the chain. Stop needing a new enemy every decade. Stop passing the wound forward to the next generation. Stop pretending conquest is destiny.</p>

  <p>Because it only takes a fracture. Break the linkage even a little, and the whole cycle starts to unravel. We could trade savagery for something less destructive, less self-consuming. Yes, maybe it means less wealth, less power, less empire—but it might mean more life, more dignity, more actual freedom than we’ve ever known.</p>

  <p>The choice isn’t complicated. It’s just hard. Admit the inheritance, break the chain, or keep circling the frontier forever until there’s nothing left but ghosts, hashtags, and the echo of punk bands and novelists screaming what should have been obvious all along.</p>
