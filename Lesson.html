    <article>
      <p><strong>My only lesson plan.</strong> If you can light a fire, make unsafe water safe, and get real calories—including fat—no one can hold your survival over your head unless they bring force. From that base, everything else in life gets easier: you can wait, you can choose, you can say no. You may never need these skills in the woods. You will need what they teach: how systems work, how to stay calm, and how to be useful.</p>

      <p>Below is what I want you to know—and why it matters for your head, your heart, and the people around you. Where it fits, I add a short <em>wu wei</em> note (道家): act with conditions, not against them; let the environment do half the work.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>1) Fire — heat, cooking, signal</h2>
      <p><strong>Skill.</strong> Make and sustain fire in foul weather; boil; cook; run a low-smoke fire.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it works.</strong> Combustion = fuel + oxygen + heat. Wet wood wastes heat driving off water. Shape, spacing, and draft matter as much as spark.</p>
      <p><strong>How this makes you stronger.</strong> Fire is immediate control over your environment. Knowing you can create warmth on command lowers panic. Calm thinking returns. That same calm is what you bring into exams, interviews, negotiations.</p>
      <p><strong>How to be helpful.</strong> Fire lets you dry others’ clothes, cook for the group, warm hands, and signal. You become the person who stabilizes a scene.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Wu wei</em> note.</strong> Don’t fight the wind—use it. Site the fire where terrain blocks gusts; build a reflector so heat returns to you. Let draft feed the flame instead of you fanning yourself tired.</p>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Drill.</strong> In rain, split wet sticks and bring 2 liters to a rolling boil in under 30 minutes.</div>

      <h2>2) Water — find, make safe, carry</h2>
      <p><strong>Skill.</strong> Choose sources; pre-filter; boil as your main method; have a backup (filter + chemical/UV); store clean.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it works.</strong> Filtration removes particles; disinfectants/heat kill microbes. Boiling does not remove chemical toxins or algal poisons—so choose sources wisely.</p>
      <p><strong>How this makes you stronger.</strong> Hydration is cognition. Safe water means less illness, more school/work days, and fewer dumb mistakes.</p>
      <p><strong>How to be helpful.</strong> In any outage: set up a safe-water station, boil for elders, teach ORS (rehydration) when someone gets sick.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Wu wei</em> note.</strong> Pick water where it wants to be clean: moving, shaded, upstream of activity. Let gravity settle silt before you lift a finger.</p>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Drill.</strong> Produce 8–12 liters of safe water in a day for two people, plus a 24-hour reserve.</div>

      <h2>3) Food — reliable calories (include fat)</h2>
      <p><strong>Skill.</strong> Prefer reliable sources over guesses: fish (line/trap/weir), shellfish where safe, small-game traps if you’ve trained/it’s legal, high-confidence plants (tubers, nuts). Dry/smoke. Render fat.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it works.</strong> You run on calories, not optimism. “Rabbit starvation” (all protein, no fat) can ruin you while you feel full. Micronutrients matter over time.</p>
      <p><strong>How this makes you stronger.</strong> Stable calories flatten cortisol; patience improves; you stop making scarcity decisions. That is the backbone of long-term choices—school, money, relationships.</p>
      <p><strong>How to be helpful.</strong> Feed people. Share skills without showing off. Build small reserves so you can help quietly when others are squeezed.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Wu wei</em> note.</strong> Take what the landscape offers easily. If fish are running, fish; if nuts are heavy, gather. Don’t force low-yield tasks because they look “hardcore.”</p>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Drill.</strong> Hit 2,500–3,500 kcal on a heavy-work day with at least one fat source.</div>

      <h2>4) Shelter &amp; sleep — thermoregulation</h2>
      <p><strong>Skill.</strong> Block wind/rain; insulate from ground; manage condensation; sleep warm.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it works.</strong> Heat loss is conduction (ground), convection (wind), radiation (open sky). Insulation traps air; small vents stop “rain on the inside.”</p>
      <p><strong>How this makes you stronger.</strong> Sleep is decision-making. Warm, dry sleep protects your judgment better than any “hack.”</p>
      <p><strong>How to be helpful.</strong> Build the group a dry bed, a drip edge, a door baffle. People think clearer when they’re not shivering.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Wu wei</em> note.</strong> Let the hill, trees, and debris do most of the shelter work. Site selection beats brute construction.</p>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Drill.</strong> Sleep eight hours at freezing temperatures with improvised insulation and wake up dry.</div>

      <h2>5) Sanitation &amp; field medicine — prevent first</h2>
      <p><strong>Skill.</strong> Latrine placement; hand-wash routine; wound irrigation/covering; simple splints; ORS mixing.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it works.</strong> Most “epic” failures start boring: GI illness, infected cuts, dehydration. ORS works by co-transport of sugar and salt across the gut.</p>
      <p><strong>How this makes you stronger.</strong> Fewer sick days = more continuity. You keep commitments; you become dependable to yourself.</p>
      <p><strong>How to be helpful.</strong> Set up a clean prep area; teach hand-washing; clean wounds for people who are scared to look.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Wu wei</em> note.</strong> Put your waste where gravity already carries it away from camp. Don’t fight physics; arrange for it.</p>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Drill.</strong> Two-week rough-conditions stretch with zero GI episodes.</div>
      <div class="callout mono"><strong>Pocket recipe (memorize).</strong> ORS = 1 liter water + 6 level teaspoons sugar + ½ level teaspoon salt. Taste: not saltier than tears.</div>

      <h2>6) Mobility, navigation &amp; signaling — move by choice</h2>
      <p><strong>Skill.</strong> Map/compass day and night; pace count; use handrails/backstops; whistle/mirror/panel; route planning.</p>
      <p><strong>Why it works.</strong> Bearing and resection turn terrain into coordinates. Signals work because they create contrast and pattern brains are tuned to notice.</p>
      <p><strong>How this makes you stronger.</strong> Optionality. You can reach better jobs, services, and communities—and leave bad situations without drama.</p>
      <p><strong>How to be helpful.</strong> Lead the route; mark a safe return; call attention when a group gets scattered.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Wu wei</em> note.</strong> Flow with terrain—contour lines and handrails reduce effort. Resist the urge to cut straight lines through problems the landscape already solved.</p>
      <div class="callout"><strong>Drill.</strong> Navigate a 20 km loop with two resections, no GPS.</div>

      <h2>Philosophical through-line</h2>
      <p><strong>Freedom is a posture.</strong> The point is not to “escape to the woods.” It’s to know, in your bones, that you can meet base needs. That knowledge returns your attention to higher-order choices.</p>
      <p><strong>Use power to reduce fear</strong>—for you and others. The test of mastery is how calm people feel around you, not how impressed they feel.</p>
      <p><strong><em>Wu wei</em> in daily life.</strong> Look for the minimum effective action. Place things so they work without constant effort. Let time, gravity, and flow do what they already do.</p>

      <h2>Modern translations (why this helps in society)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fire → energy literacy.</strong> You’ll understand heating, ventilation, and bills. You won’t panic in outages; you won’t overpay for “emergency” convenience.</li>
        <li><strong>Water → infrastructure literacy.</strong> You’ll read boil-water notices and filtration claims without being scammed. You’ll spot upstream problems early.</li>
        <li><strong>Food → time preference.</strong> A steady pantry and calorie plan let you wait for good opportunities instead of grabbing bad ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Shelter/sleep → cognition.</strong> Rested brains negotiate better and learn faster.</li>
        <li><strong>Sanitation/medicine → continuity.</strong> Fewer avoidable setbacks. You keep momentum.</li>
        <li><strong>Mobility/nav → options.</strong> More paths = less coercion. You can always “walk.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Rituals for your pocket</h2>
      <p><strong>Before action:</strong> Pause → Breathe (4 slow) → Scan (environment, options, minimum move).</p>
      <p><strong>Three questions:</strong> 1) What is the minimum that solves it? 2) What is the environment already giving me? 3) How do I help without creating new problems?</p>

      <h2>Guardrails</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Laws and land access are real.</li>
        <li>Boiling doesn’t fix chemicals or algal toxins. Avoid bright-green scum, obvious runoff, mine/ag zones.</li>
        <li>In cold rain, shelter and dry core beat food—always.</li>
        <li>Three whistle blasts = help. Three is a pattern people hear.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mantra</h2>
      <p><strong>I can make heat, water, and calories. I can’t be owned.</strong><br/>
      I use that freedom to keep others warm, watered, fed, and calm.</p>

      <p>You don’t have to master this overnight. Practice a little, quarterly. Keep it simple. The goal isn’t to become “a survivalist.” The goal is to be hard to coerce and easy to rely on.</p>
