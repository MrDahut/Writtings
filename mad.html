  <h1> "I'm mad as hell!"</h1>

  <p>We live in the age of no witnesses. Not because no one saw—but because everyone saw, and chose silence.</p>

  <p>There’s a woman, walked off a job last night, heart pounding like gunfire in her throat. Not because she couldn’t take it—but because she’d already taken too much. Because her hands were still shaking from holding the whole place together while the world around her shrugged. She kept the peace. She kept the schedule. She kept from screaming. But no one kept her.</p>

  <p>And there's a man—call him Mangione—standing on the edge of his own limit. Thought about throwing someone off a roof. Didn’t do it. Just thought it. But in that moment, he saw the shape of the hole the system had left inside him. No more safety nets. No more warnings. Just bone-deep exhaustion and the quiet knowledge that if he ever lost his grip, no one would catch him—not law, not HR, not God. That man was able to once again swallow his bile and not act. Luigi had no room left.</p>

  <p>Then there’s the builder. Rolled the dice, chased the dream. Got the doors open and the payroll met, just in time for the world to fall apart again. 2019, COVID, shutdowns, inflation, gas spikes, supply chain implosions. He patched every hole until the patches became the skin. And still—every time he gasped for air, someone else called it weakness.</p>

  <p>This is the pattern: people falling through cracks that were carved on purpose.</p>

  <p>We’ve been trained like dogs to apologize when we bleed. To say thank you when the knife goes a little slower. To measure sanity by how well we suffer without comment. To trade dignity for permission to survive.</p>

  <p>Our women are bruised and gaslit and still expected to smile. Our men are wound tight, snarling in the corners of forums and feedlines, just waiting for someone to validate the anger they’ve been told is shameful. Our workers are quitting mid-shift, shaking, crying, then blaming themselves. Our kids are watching all of this and learning, early, that no one’s coming.</p>

  <p>And the predators? They know. They can smell the hesitance. The way we all flinch before acting. The way we defer, rationalize, look away. Because we've built a nation where kindness is penalized, violence is normalized, and speaking truth is treated like a threat.</p>

  <p>So yeah—we’ve all become Kitty Genovese. Watching from the windows, telling ourselves someone else will make the call. Someone else will raise the alarm. Someone else will give a damn.</p>

  <p>But the phone's been ringing for years.</p>

  <p>And if you’re reading this—you are the someone.</p>

  <p>This isn’t a call for violence. It’s a call for witness. A call to intervene when the system stays silent. A call to remember that laws without justice are just contracts we didn’t sign. And pressure without outlet becomes explosion.</p>

  <p>And that’s why the Epstein case matters. Not because some particular statute was broken. Not because we finally want to tally who flew where and with whom. But because it showed us—again—that accountability is the one thing this system cannot reliably produce. And that’s the real sickness. The silence wasn’t just personal. It was institutional. It was global. It was learned.</p>

  <p>And it’s everywhere now. From the courthouse to the hospital. From the jobsite to the classroom. From the street to the home. From the therapist’s office to the union hall. From the battered women’s shelter to the probation office. From the line at the pharmacy to the backroom of the gig app startup. From the online support group to the emergency room hallway where a nurse cries because she’s charting her third code blue this week and no one brought her a goddamn coffee.</p>

  <p>This isn’t new. This is American tradition—</p>

  <p>A legacy of generational trauma varnished in optimism.</p>

  <p>We told the Boomers they were lucky. They weren’t. They were scared children hiding under desks from missiles while their parents beat the war out of their own bones.</p>

  <p>Then came Generation X—raised on latchkeys and nuclear countdowns, taught to laugh at apocalypse because nobody else was listening.</p>

  <p>Millennials got debt, recession, and climate dread—told they were entitled for wanting a place to live.</p>

  <p>Zoomers? They’re growing up in a nation with no memory of peace, no faith in democracy, no shelter from algorithmic despair.</p>

  <p>This is the churn. It doesn’t stop. It just rebrands. It finds a new mask every decade and tells us it’s our fault.</p>

  <p>But good people are being broken by it. Quietly. Daily. Irreparably. People who still try to do right even when they’re drowning. People who show up, who carry the load, who swallow the scream and call it composure. People who fix the machine with duct tape and grace, and still get blamed when it fails.</p>

  <p>So tell the story. Every story. Put it in the street, in the air, in the fucking bloodstream of the culture until silence itself becomes complicit. Until the next worker doesn’t have to choose between quitting and collapsing. Until the next woman doesn’t have to beg to be believed. Until the next Mangione never even has to make a bad choice or worse choice. Until no man with money and a flight log can buy silence again.</p>

  <p>This is not sustainable.</p>

  <p>You know it. I know it. They know it.</p>

  <p>So say it. Loud. Raw. Unapologetic.</p>

  <p>Because the only thing worse than what’s happening—is pretending it isn’t.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align: center;">No more witnesses. No more permission.</h2>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Just us, and the truth, and the choice to finally act.
                  Because we can't afford to take it anymore!
